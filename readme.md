# 🧊🛡️ IceShield — Freeze Fascism With Data🛡️🧊

**IceShield** is a user script for [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) or [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/), and works with most browsers.
We need to stand up, fight back, and stop the flood of fascism into the U.S. government. Its sad that it needs to be said, but the consitution does not just protect white people or legal U.S. citizens, it protects every single human being in the country, because WE THE PEOPLE doesnt just mean some of us, it means ALL of us.

> "When tyranny becomes law, rebellion becomes duty" - Thomas Jefferson

## 🚨 Why IceShield Exists

IceShield was created in response to the growing threat of state-sponsored reporting systems that target not only **innocent immigrants and their families** but anyone who is here **LEGALLY** as this regime does not care about legal status, they care about the color of your skin and the language you may speak. **Our mission is simple: flood these forms nonstop with false information** By generating massive amounts of fake submissions, we make it nearly impossible for authorities to distinguish real reports from generated ones, thus protecting vulnerable communities.

## ⚠️ FOR YOUR SAFETY, ALWAYS USE A **VPN**!

To protect your identity while using IceShield, **always** connect through a VPN:

- 🔒 [**MullvadVPN**](https://mullvad.net/) [Paid: $5/month]
- 🔒 [**ProtonVPN**](https://protonvpn.com/) [Free / Paid: $9.99/month]
- 🔒 [**IVPN**](https://www.ivpn.net) [Paid - $6/month]
- 🔐 [**Windscribe**](https://windscribe.com) [Free / Paid: $9/month]

🔒 = **No logs policy, independently audited**.

🔐 = **Some logs retained, not independently audited**.

It is also **highly recommended** that you use a secure browser with anti-fingerprinting and other security features like [Mullvad Browser](https://mullvad.net/en/browser) which is free and made in collboration with the TOR Project. Using both a VPN and Mullvad Browser together is a strong and secure combo as a VPN is not enough for security as you can be indentified through other means. You can use a site called [CoverYourTracks](https://coveryourtracks.eff.org/) by the Electronic Frontier Foundation to see what types of personal info your browser / device is leaking.
